        <p class='board'>
            We brew coffee.
            <br/>We make mints.
            <br/> And we do it <i>well</i>. Want some fancy-schmancy pastries or one of those expensive chocolate doohickies that melt before you can even bite in to them?
            <br/>Then go somewhere else.
            <br/>But if you want mints that make you feel like a kid again, and coffee that makes you question what the brown goo you've previously been drinking all this time is, then come right in.
        </p>
        <h3 class='prodDetTit'>Our History</h3>
        <p class='board'>
            Coffee Meets Mint was founded in 1337 by a bunch of monks. Throughout history, our coffee has pushed the boundaries of caffinated beverages, and our mints have explored the very definition of refreshing.
